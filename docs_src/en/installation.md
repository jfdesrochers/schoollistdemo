# Installation

Next we will proceed to installing School List Manager.

## Starting the setup program

On the USB drive that you prepared [in the last step](gettingstarted/#preparing-the-school-lists), double-click on `SLMSetup.exe`.

## User Account Control

Once you open the program, you will be faced with a security consent screen similar to the one below. Click on `Yes` to continue.

!!! summary "Why is this screen appearing?"
    You are seeing this because Windows does not know the publisher of this program (which is me) and it is warning you that it could be a potential security risk. Unfortunately, obtaining what is necessary to be _recognized_ by Windows is costly and outside the scope of this small project. However, as long as you are following the steps outlined in this guide, there are no risks involved.

## Finishing the setup and starting the program

The installer is completely automated, all you have to do is wait for it to complete. The progress might seems like it is freezing at times, but this is normal because of the large quantity of files being copied.

Double-click on the desktop shortcut to launch the program. If you lose this shortcut, the program is located in `Documents\schoollistman`.

Once the program is open, we can start [setting it up](setup).
