# Getting Started

Here are a few steps that need to be done before you can start the application.

## Necessary hardware

To be able to properly use the program, please ensure that the following hardware is in place :

* An all-in-one computer, preferably with a touch screen: this will create a greater customer experience with the program.
* A black and white printer, preferably laser: to print the school lists.
* A USB drive with at least 4 GB of space to put the school lists on.

!!! important
    Make sure that the computer you are using is completely set up and that the Retail Demo mode **is not** active, because this mode completely wipes personal data, which obviously would be catastrophic in our case.

!!! note
    Also make sure that the printer driver is properly installed and that the printer is the **default** one in Windows. We also suggest to check the default paper setting, because some printer drivers set the european `A4` format instead of the correct `letter` and that would cause the lists to print only partially. We recommend to plug in your printer directly with a USB cable to avoid any network related issues.

## Preparing the school lists

This step is crucial as the entire project is built around it and the more attention you put into this, the less work is going to be needed later on.

### Prepare the USB drive

1. Plug your USB drive into a computer (we suggest the Copy Center computer, as Adobe Acrobat may be needed) and create a folder named `School Lists`.
2. Download the setup program for School List Manager `SLMSetup.exe` and copy it on the drive as well.

### Add folders for the schools

In the `School Lists` folder, create additional folders for every school for which you have the lists.

### Create a PDF file for each class

Finally, in each school folder, create a PDF file for every class or group in that school. It is important that each list has its own file and that all files are in PDF format. Use Adobe Acrobat to achieve that if necessary.

!!! warning "Warning !"
    Please make sure that all your file / folder names are perfectly adequate: the right punctuation, the right letter case and the right spelling. This way they will be imported properly and you will not have to manually rename them later.

Once the drive is ready, we can move on to the all-in-one computer and install everything in [the next step](installation).
