# First time setup

What you now have in front of you is a first time setup wizard. It has been made to be the most easy to use, but this guide will still follow along and comment on the way.

## Language choice

The first question is easy: choose the language that corresponds to the main language spoken in your store (since you are reading this guide, I'm assuming that it is _english_).

Some stores have both english and french customers. If that is the case for your store, you can change the main screen to display a language choice.

Here is how the main screen looks like with the bilingual option on and off :

## Informations about your store

This next step involves entering your store and district number. They will be used to identify your store in the statistics and as an PIN number to access some features (more on all that in the next section).

## Internet Connectivity

This next step simply makes sure that Internet is working on your computer. It will also help you get connected if necessary.

!!! summary "Why is internet connectivity _that_ important?"
    The program transmits data on its usage (imported school lists, print statistics, etc.) to a central database. This will allow us to measure the popularity of the project and to identify possible issues with the program or the setup process. There is also a feedback tool integrated into the program that requires internet to work (more on that in the next section). Here is an example of the kind of data we collect :

## Loading the lists from the USB drive

We will now import the lists that you have prepared previously. The wizard will first remind you how to prepare the drive, you can click `Continue` in that, and then you will get to the screen shown below. Simply click on your drive in the list to start the process.

Once the lists are loaded, you will get to the following screen which indicates all the lists that have been imported :

!!! failure "Potential problems"
    If the program does not find any PDF file on the drive, if it does not load the correct files or if it displays an error, please make sure that the only files present on the drive are the ones we prepared earlier (`School Lists` and `SLMSetup.exe`). Sometimes other files can interfere with the process.

## Setup is complete!

The last screen is basically a welcome screen and it tells you how to access the settings panel, which we will get to next. The program is now completely ready to use.

!!! note "Advice"
    We recommend to shut down the computer every night and boot it up every morning. Since School List Manager bypasses the normal sleep functionality of the computer, turning it off will prolong its life and avoid some bugs that can occur when a computer is on for too long. There is a button in the settings panel (which we will see next) that allows you to close the program using the touch screen.

    We recommend also to keep a mouse and keyboard close by, especially for using the settings, as data entry may be needed. You can remove it afterwards.

Now let's see how to access and change the settings in [the next section](settingsandmore).
