# Settings and more!

## How to access the settings menu

To access the settings menu, double-click on the Staples logo in the lower left corner of the main screen.

You will need to enter an access code (PIN number). The access code is comprised of your store number prepended with '0', making a total of 4 digits. For example, if your store number is `999`, your access code will be `0999`. If your store number is `40`, your access code will be `0040` and so on...

This will get you to the settings panel :

Some settings, notably : `Language settings`, `Store information` and `Load new lists from USB` are simply repeating the steps from the initial setup. We will cover the next 3 options in this guide.

## Edit the schools and the lists

Like most of the program, this screen is self-explanatory. You click on the `+` buttons to show the classes. You use the pencil buttons to rename the classes or the schools and the `x` buttons to delete them. None of these operations will be made permanent until you click the `Save` button. That way, if you made a mistake, you can always go back and do it again.

    Like the program notes, once you press the save button, you cannot go back. You will lose the data from deleted schools or classes, including print statistics, and you will have to re-import if you need the recover them.

## View the print statistics

Here is a nice tool that will help you in your networking with the schools: usage statistics. In this menu, you can see which schools have parents who shop in your store by tracking which lists are printed the most.
